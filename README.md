# Project 3: Spots

## Project Description:

This is the third Tripleten project -Spots- that tackles responsive design of webpage elements across various viewports. The project is divided into three parts: Profile, Cards, and Footer. The design incorporates responsive design technologies for the aforementioned parts like Grid, Flexbox, and relative values in CSS all the while ensuring that displays with width 320px or more don't have horizontal scaling.

## Plan on improving the project:

While the project sets the stage for a responsive UI design for a spots website and is functional via js, it can be imporved by adding a few animations. The next iteration would be sending data across the wire to an endpoint server and subsequently collecting the data in a relational/object/block storage for querying/analytics further downstream.
