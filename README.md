# Project 3: Spots

## Project Description:

This is the third Tripleten project that tackles responsive design of webpage elements across various viewports. The project is divided into three parts: Profile, Cards, and Footer. The design incorporates responsive design technologies for the aforementioned parts like Grid, Flexbox, and relative values in CSS all the while ensuring that displays with width 320px or more don't have horizontal scaling.

## Plan on improving the project:

While the project sets the stage for a functional and responsive UI design for a spots website, it can be imporved by adding a few animations. Secondly, we are currently only using HTML and CSS technologies without JS. The next iteration of this project would be to use JS to make it more performant by sending data across the wire to an endpoint server and subsequently collecting the data in a relational/object/block storage for querying/analytics further downstream.
